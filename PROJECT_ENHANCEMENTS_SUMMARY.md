- Easy to use command-line interface

## 8. Performance Improvements
### Caching Benefits:
- Reduced API calls to external services (Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko)
- Faster response times for repeated requests
- Better resource utilization
- Improved user experience with quicker data loading

## 9. Code Quality Enhancements
### Improvements:
- Better error handling with detailed logging
- More comprehensive test coverage
- Modular design with separate services
- Improved documentation and comments

- Data export functionality (CSV, Excel)
- Mobile application development
- Advanced portfolio analytics
- Machine learning-based predictions

## Summary
The enhancements made to the FastAPI Finance Monitor project have significantly improved its robustness, performance, and maintainability. The addition of caching reduces external API dependencies and improves response times, while the expanded test suite ensures code quality and reliability. The new technical indicators provide more comprehensive market analysis capabilities, and the modular design makes future enhancements easier to implement.
